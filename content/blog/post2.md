# So what is going on with parch linux ?
parch linux development is a very slow process and it needs a lot of attention to be done correctly.
The parch linux development team, which is now a part of the bss foundation, continues to work as before.
## What has changed after parch linux joined the foundation? 
Nothing!
Only foundation programs were added to this operating system by default, and the support of this operating system was expanded and now it is considered one of the projects of the foundation.

### Development roadmap
- [ ] Publish the new parch linux website
- [ ] Publish the first pre-release iso of parch mate
- [ ] Publish the stable release of parch linux plasma
- [ ] Publish the stable release of parch linux next
- [ ] Publish Foundation software and some software only for parchlinux
